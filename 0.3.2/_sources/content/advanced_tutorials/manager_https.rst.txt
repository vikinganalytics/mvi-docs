Secure Manager Connection
=========================

It is possible to get a secure HTTPS connection to the manager using automatically
created certificates from `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org>`. For this to work,
the server must have a valid hostname which sersolves via DNS to the server's IP
address. It will not work if you access the manager using an IP addres or
``localhost`` due to how TLS certificates are generated.

To enable HTTPS you must start a new manager with the environment variable
``MVI_PROXY_HTTPS`` set to true. We also recommend that you set an email
address with the environment variable ``MVI_CONFIG_EMAIL``, so you can get
notified if the certificate is about to run out. All in all, to start a manager
with a secure connection run the following command:

>>> docker run --name mvi_manager -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v mvi_data:/data -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -e MVI_HOST_NAME="your-host-name.com" -e MVI_AUTH_ENABLED=True -e MVI_CONFIG_EMAIL="your@email.com" -e MVI_PROXY_HTTPS=True -d vikinganalyticsab/mvi_manager:latest
