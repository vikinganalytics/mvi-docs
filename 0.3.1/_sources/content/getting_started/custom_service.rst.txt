Creating Your Own service
=========================

This tutorial will continue from where :ref:`first-service-reference` left off.
There we created a basic service using the ``mvi init`` command.

>>> mvi init
project_name [my_project]: my_first_mvi_project

And this created three files and a directory.

>>> ls ./my_first_mvi_project -a
.  ..  .s2i  README.md  requirements.txt  service.py

Where `service.py` contains the service source code. Let's look at how a typical
`service.py` file might look.

Setup
-----

As usual, the first step is to import packages::


    import logging
    from mvi.mvi import MviService, notify, Severity

Only :py:class:`~mvi.mvi.MviService` is actually required, but we recommend to import
and use the standard python `logging <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>`_ 
package. :py:func:`~mvi.mvi.notify` and :py:class:`~mvi.mvi.Severity` are used
for the notification functionality in MVI. 

If any external packages are used, they must be specified in the `requirements.txt` file. 
That way they will be installed the service is deployed. 

.. note:: It is highly recommended to **pin** your requirements to specific versions when 
    in a production environment, for example `numpy==1.19.4`

Next we initialize a :py:class:`~mvi.mvi.MviService` object and a logger::

    mvi = MviService()
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

The :py:class:`~mvi.mvi.MviService` object helps us set up entrypoints for the service,
add parameters and start the service. The logger is just a regular python logging
object, which MVI natively supports. The logs from a service can be read from the
dashboard or using ``mvi logs <name> <version>``.

.. _custom-service_defining_parameters-reference:

Defining parameters
-------------------

It is possible to define variables that automatically get exposed to the API and
can be freely changed from outside a running service::

    mvi.add_parameter("greeting_phrase", "Hello")

To use the parameter in the code you do::

    greeting_phrase = mvi.get_parameter("greeting_phrase")


This way you can control the behaviour of your running services without having
to make any code changes. We recommend using this for e.g. tuning parameters.

These parameters can be changed via the docs of the service, see :ref:`autodocs-reference` for how to do it.
Another way to change these parameters is by sending HTTP POST requests directly, for instance via pythons `requests <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_ library.

Example of changing the ``greeting_phrase`` parameter for this service::

    json_data = {"greeting_phrase": "Bonjour"}

    response = requests.post(
        "http:://<host>/services/<my_service>/parameters/greeting_phrase",
        json=json_data,
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}"})

Creating an Entrypoint
----------------------

To define an entrypoint for a service we use the :py:meth:`~mvi.mvi.MviService.entrypoint`
decorator::

    @mvi.entrypoint
    def hello(name: str) -> str:
        greeting_phrase = mvi.get_parameter("greeting_phrase")
        logger.info(f"Greeting someone with the name: {name}")
        return f"{greeting_phrase} {name}"

This will automatically expose the :py:func:`hello` function to the API. We strongly
recommend that you use type hints in your MVI entrypoint functions. That way, you
will get type verification in your API and the auto-generated documentation will show
the expected data types. Please take a look at :ref:`sdk-typing-reference` for a
more detailed guide on how typing is handled in MVI.

Notifications
-------------

Notifications is another feature of MVI. When a notification is raised it can be viewed
on the dashboard at http://your-host or sent to an email address. To add a notification
we use the :py:func:`~mvi.mvi.notify` function. They can be placed in a conditional statement
to send a notification if it's true. With notifications added, the :py:func:`hello` function
now looks like this::

    @mvi.entrypoint
    def hello(name: str) -> str:
        greeting_phrase = mvi.get_parameter("greeting_phrase")
        if name == "World":
            notify(
                msg="Someone is trying to greet the World, too time consuming. Skipping!",
                severity=Severity.WARNING,
            )
            return "Greeting failed"
        logger.info(f"Greeting someone with the name: {name}")
        return f"{greeting_phrase} {name}"

Here we want to stop the user from greeting the world, because that would take
a lot of time. So if the name is "World" we send a notification.

Starting the Service
--------------------

The last thing we have to do is to ensure the service runs once it is deployed::

    mvi.run()


Full Code
---------

The code we just looked at is the same code that is generated by ``mvi init`` by
default. It is fewer than 25 lines of code to create a fully functional service
complete with logging, notifications and configurable parameters. All together it
looks like this::

    import logging
    from mvi.mvi import MviService, notify, Severity

    mvi = MviService()
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    mvi.add_parameter("greeting_phrase", "Hello")


    @mvi.entrypoint
    def hello(name: str) -> str:
        greeting_phrase = mvi.get_parameter("greeting_phrase")
        if name == "World":
            notify(
                msg="Someone is trying to greet the World, too time consuming. Skipping!",
                severity=Severity.WARNING,
            )
            return "Greeting failed"
        logger.info(f"Greeting someone with the name: {name}")
        return f"{greeting_phrase} {name}"


    mvi.run()

Deploying the Service
---------------------

As a reminder from :ref:`first-service-reference` we will deploy our new service.

>>> mvi deploy hello 1.0.0 ./my_first_mvi_project/
Deploying service...
Service deployed successfully
MAIN    NAME    VERSION    STATUS    RUNNING
------  ------  ---------  --------  -----------------------------------
*       hello   1.0.0      running   Running (since 2020-11-23 10:29:01)

What's Next?
------------

Now you have seen the different components of the SDK and you should be ready to
create your own service. The next step could be to take a look at the
manager :ref:`dashboard-reference`, or the :ref:`sdk-reference` documentation.
