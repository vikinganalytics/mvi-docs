API Autodocs
============

MVI automatically creates interactive documentation for every service created using
the :ref:`sdk-reference`. It can be found at
http://your-host/services/servicename_version/docs. For the `hello` service we
created in :ref:`custom-service-reference` it can be reached at 
http://your-host/services/hello_1.0.0/docs and looks like this:

Interacting with the Docs
-------------------------

Each endpoint function in the documentation can be clicked to get more information
about the data it expects and an example of a successful response and more. Let's try
the ``hello/`` function. Try it once with your name and once with "World". With your
name it should return "Hello <name>" and for "World" you should get "Greeting failed".

We expect to have gotten a notification, because in the code we wanted to raise a
notification if a user tried to greet the world, because of time constraints.
So head over to http://your-host/dashboard/ and click the notifications tab.
And we will see the notification there.

What's Next?
------------

Now you have seen how to inspect and test a deployed service without
having to write any code. The usefulness of the documentation can be increased
with smart usage of type hints and the
`pydantic <https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/>`_ package. Take a look at 
:ref:`sdk-typing-reference` to learn more. Or continue to
:ref:`versioning-shadow-reference` to learn more on how to test and switch between
different versions of services without downtime.
