Cross-service Communication
===========================

Microservices is a modern software architectural style where an application consists
of a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployable services. These
small services communicate with each other to form large and complex applications.

In this tutorial we will build a yatzee game consisting of two services, one that
throws a die and another that handles the game logic.

Die Roller Service
-------------------

The first service we create will generate a random number between 1 and 6 and
respond with the result:

>>> mvi init
Active host: http://your-host
project_name [my_project]: die_roller_service

Modify the code in `service.py` to::

    import logging
    from mvi.mvi import MviService
    from random import randint

    mvi = MviService()

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


    @mvi.entrypoint
    def roll_die() -> int:
        return randint(1, 6)


    mvi.run()

Deploy the service:

>>> mvi deploy die_roller 1.0.0 ./die_roller_service
Active host: http://your-host
Deploying service...
Service deployed successfully
MAIN    NAME         VERSION    STATUS    RUNNING
------  -----------  ---------  --------  -----------------------------------
*       die_roller   1.0.0      running   Running (since 2020-11-24 11:56:18)

You can test if the service works correctly by going to the interactive 
documentation at http://your-host/services/die_roller/docs.

Yatzee Service
--------------

The `yatzee` service will call the :py:func:`roll_die` method of the `die_roller`
for each die in play. If the player gets a yatzee (all 6s) we send a notification!
Let's create the code for that service:

>>> mvi init
Active host: http://your-host
project_name [my_project]: yatzee_service

And modify `service.py` to::

    import logging
    from mvi.mvi import MviService, notify, Severity, call_service

    mvi = MviService()

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


    @mvi.entrypoint
    def play() -> list:
        n_dice = 5
        die_rolls = []

        for _ in range(n_dice):
            die_roll = call_service(
                service_name="die_roller",
                entrypoint_name="roll_die",
            )
            die_rolls.append(die_roll)
        
        if sum(die_rolls) == 6 * n_dice:
            notify(
                msg="YATZEE!!!",
                severity=Severity.INFO,
            )

        return sorted(die_rolls)


    mvi.run()

Deploy the service:

>>> mvi deploy yatzee 1.0.0 ./yatzee_service
Active host: http://your-host
Deploying service...
Service deployed successfully
MAIN    NAME    VERSION    STATUS    RUNNING
------  ------  ---------  --------  -----------------------------------
*       yatzee  1.0.0      running   Running (since 2020-11-24 12:15:57)


We use the :py:func:`~mvi.mvi.call_service` function to call an entrypoint in
another service. In this case, the :py:func:`roll_die` function of the `die_roller`
service. Notice how we did not specify any version of `die_roller`, this way
the main version will be used. If you wanted to specify a version, then you should
use the keyword argument ``service_version``.

Now that you've come this far you have seen most of the fundamentals of MVI. 
Be sure that you have taken a look at the documentation for the
:ref:`sdk-reference` and the :ref:`cli-reference`. After which you should be ready
to move on to the advanced tutorials.
