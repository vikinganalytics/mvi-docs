Email Notifications
===================

If you remember from :ref:`custom-service-reference`, we created a `hello` service
with a :func:`hello` entrypoint that took a name and responded with a greeting_phrase

.. testcode::

    import logging
    from mvi import service
    from mvi.communication import notify, Severity

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    service.add_parameter("greeting_phrase", "Hello")

    @service.entrypoint
    def hello(name: str) -> str:
        greeting_phrase = service.get_parameter("greeting_phrase")
        if name == "World":
            notify(
                msg="Someone is trying to greet the World, too time consuming. Skipping!",
                severity=Severity.WARNING,
            )
            return "Greeting failed"
        logger.info(f"Greeting someone with the name: {name}")
        return f"{greeting_phrase} {name}"

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        service.run()

If the user tried to greet "World", a notification would be raised, which could be
viewed in the notification tab of the dashboard. In this tutorial we will see how
that same notification can be sent as an email.

Manager Configuration
---------------------

The first step is to set up an email address that the MVI Manager can use to send
the notification emails. For this you need an
`SMTP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol>`_ server with
an email account that you can use. We recommend to have a dedicated email address
for sending MVI notifications.

The manager is configured with a notification sender email at startup. We do this
by setting four different environment variables at manager startup

+----------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| Environment Variable                   | Value                 |
+========================================+=======================+
| MVI_NOTIFICATION_SENDER_EMAIL          | "email@address.com"   |
+----------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| MVI_NOTIFICATION_SENDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD | "password"            |
+----------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| MVI_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_SERVER           | "smtp.server.url"     |
+----------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| MVI_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PORT             | Usually 587 or 465    |
+----------------------------------------+-----------------------+

With the docker CLI:

>>> docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -e MVI_AUTH_ENABLED=True -e MVI_NOTIFICATION_SENDER_EMAIL="email@address.com" -e MVI_NOTIFICATION_SENDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD="password" -e MVI_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_SERVER="smtp.server.url" -e MVI_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PORT=465 -d vikinganalyticsab/mvi_manager:latest # doctest: +SKIP

If everything worked, an email will be sent from "email@address.com" to itself, to
show that it successfully connected. Otherwise, as long as the manager could still
start, any issues with the email configuration will be viewable on the notification
tab in the dashboard.
Some configuration of the Manager is also needed to get going, please refer to
:ref:`manager-configuration-reference`.

SDK Syntax
----------

By default, :func:`~mvi.communication.notify` with not send any emails. For a notification to
become an email notification, you have to pass a list of email addresses to the ``emails``
keyword argument of :func:`~mvi.communication.notify`


.. testcode::

    import logging
    from mvi import service
    from mvi.communication import notify, Severity

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    service.add_parameter("greeting_phrase", "Hello")

    @service.entrypoint
    def hello(name: str) -> str:
        greeting_phrase = service.get_parameter("greeting_phrase")
        if name == "World":
            notify(
                msg="Someone is trying to greet the World, too time consuming. Skipping!",
                severity=Severity.WARNING,
                emails=["your@email.com"],
            )
            return "Greeting failed"
        logger.info(f"Greeting someone with the name: {name}")
        return f"{greeting_phrase} {name}"

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        service.run()

To make the email recipients dynamically changeable, we can use this in conjunction with
:func:`~mvi.service.add_parameter` like so

.. testcode::

    import logging
    from mvi import service
    from mvi.communication import notify, Severity

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    service.add_parameter("greeting_phrase", "Hello")
    service.add_parameter("emails", ["your@email.com"])

    @service.entrypoint
    def hello(name: str) -> str:
        greeting_phrase = service.get_parameter("greeting_phrase")
        emails = service.get_parameter("emails")
        if name == "World":
            notify(
                msg="Someone is trying to greet the World, too time consuming. Skipping!",
                severity=Severity.WARNING,
                emails=emails,
            )
            return "Greeting failed"
        logger.info(f"Greeting someone with the name: {name}")
        return f"{greeting_phrase} {name}"

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        service.run()

This way, email addresses can be added and removed. You could of course use different emails
for different notifications, so different stakeholders get notified of different things.
